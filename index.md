**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic I learned this quarter is change point detection. Change point detection is a signal processing tool used on time series data in order to find the point in the data where a statistical property like mean or variance changes significantly. During this quarter we used change point detection to find the points in time where mice in an experiment change their activity or behavior significantly.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
One potential investigation I would like to pursue in the quarter 2 project is to use change point detection to figure out when exactly mice start feeling the effects of different amounts of morphine after it is administered. We can use change point detection to figure out where the biometric measures of a mice changes after morphine is administered. And how this changes with different quantities of morphine.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In our current quarter 1 project we are currently using mice data that only contains activity and temperature. I would like to use a more extensive dataset so we can explore different features and how it changes as mice are exposed to different circumstances. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I'd like to add methods that would complement change point detection, such as including circular statistics. Since the data that we have is cyclical in form, 24 hour periods, it might be useful to explore circular statistics and models such as von mises distribution that is designed to deal with data of this sort.
